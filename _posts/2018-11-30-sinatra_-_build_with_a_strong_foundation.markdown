Just finished up my Sinatra project!  Through many highs and lows I took away the simple fact to start slow.

My biggest challenge was laying down the foundation of my project.  A small mistake with either setting up the database properly or how the models were associated lead to devestating consequences.  I made the mistake of editing my migrations before rolling them back during one of the labs.  After realising what I had done and fixing my mistake none of my tests would pass.  Went into tux to test it... everything seemed to be fine.  I eventually gave up and deleted the lab and started fresh.  Making absolutely sure everything was perfect during the first runthough the labs started passing.  It never dawned on me that I also had to rollback my test ENV databse and that is what caused my headache.

That frustrating lesson lead to me taking my time on my project's foundation, and making sure everything was solid before continuing on to the views and controllers.

**A few extra minutes at the starting line will lead to a much smoother finish!**

good luck and happy coding!
