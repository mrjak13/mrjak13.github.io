I love my computer.  I built it myself, it has survived, four moves and does everything I need. Until it didn't.  I started to code and with it came issues. Thankfully Learn's IDE guided me through most of the curriculum.  One day I decided it was time to figure out how to get my own environment up and running.  Oh boy did I fail... Terribly. I am comfortable on both Mac's and Windows computers for the most part.  If I needed something,  I downloaded it... easy.  Then came this set up. I googled, did reasearch, asked for help, everything.  Then to find out that Ruby wasn't meant to work on a Windows OS, I was devastated.  My determination finally paid off and I got rails working on my compouter with the windows 10 ubuntu.  Completeted my rails project on it, java script, then onto react.  I made the mistake of trying to make life easier by installing the z shell and oh-my-zsh.  oh-my-zsh is amazing and what a game changer it has been for me.  Setting it up on my windows was not.  Countless issues getting it set up correctly resulted in my uninstalling/reinstalling everything and then it happened.  I started my react project and BAM I got the sqlite3 issue. 

I could not fix it.  I spent a week asking for help and scowering the internet to figure it out and nothing worked.  Words can not describe the frustration of being so close to graduation and I couldn't even start my project.  The only solution I could think of was to install Linux on my computer, which I have never done before.  I only had a brief test run of linux Ubuntu in the VirtualBox and this was my answer.  I found an old harddrive and got to work.

After downloading Ubuntu 18.04 to a flashdrive I was able to bootup right from there and test it out.  Within 15 minutes I had my back-end, front-end, and oh-my-zsh set up.  I could not believe that installing a new OS was the easiest soloution to this problem.  After my test run I did a full install and I have been in love ever since.  The simplicity of Linux is beautiful and I love the control I have.  Rather than Windows hiding files I need access to under piles of unnaccessable garbage, everything is just in plain site under a basic root.  Everything I had issues with finding I now had control of.  What a liberating feeling.  Even after pretty much finished school I did not think I could handle a linux system.  Never did research, just the thought overwhelmed me "I can't run Linux I woudn't know where to start" and that was that.  After hours of frustrations and nowhere else to turn to I finally made the plunge and regret nothing.

For anyone on the fence. Do it!  You can give it a test run without commitment and if it doesn't suit you, wipe the flash drive.  It's simple and easy to use.  Any issues I have come accross I had fixed within minutes.   The community is wonderful and want nothing more than an awesome experience for everyone.

Thank yo for stopping by!

Happy Coding
