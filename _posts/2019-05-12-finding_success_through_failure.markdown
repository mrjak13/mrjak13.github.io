Transitioning from Ruby to JavaScript/ECMAScript was challanging.  At least three different ways for setting variables,   methods are now functions that have no restrictions, and everything is an object.  After getting through JavaScripts fundamentals I had my first eye opening experience to the wonder that this new language held.  I manipulated the DOM.  I inserted a piece of text onto a page that was not there before and it blew my mind.  Something so simple and I immeadiately knew the potential of JS was limitless.  

With my rush of excitement I jumped into learning about event listeners and ajax... and I was terrible at it. All I got was: click a button, and magic happens.  Then implementing requests to API's and getting JSON objects.  Everything was going over my head, but with every frustrating concept I gained some familiarity. Whenever I hit a wall I would research, look up examples, ask questions.  By the time I started to add JS into my own work, I had hit so many walls and done hours of searching for references I implemented my concepts with minimal error.

The more I failed, the more I learned.  This has been my true learning experience so far as a developer and I can't wait to fail again soon.
