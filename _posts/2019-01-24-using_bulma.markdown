Going into my rails project, there were many things on my mind.  Is this idea going to cut it,  will I be able to meet the requirements seamlessly, why do I have so many models all of a sudden, etc... Out of all the elements I was concerned with, styling was not one of them.  I figured if it works, it's good enough, right?  It did not quite pan out as I anticipated.

It started when I finally got fed up navigating through my site directly through the browser url.  Enter the navbar.  After throwing a few links up I was set to cruise through my project......  But it was ugly. I hated that I stamped this disgusting navigation on the poject that I had already poured so many hours into.  Enough was enough, it was time to style.  Bootstrap is my go to after learning how functional it was, but Bulma was recommended to try out. So i pulled up bulma.io and started my research.  

**It was love at first code**

Who could have imagined that making neat and oraganized web app would be so simple.  I though of it as the "Ruby" framework because of how it is all implemented.  Need columns, use "columns", want the input on your form to have some style, use "input", how about the text that you have anywhere, "has-text-providcolorhere".  They use a color system that is easy to remember and are tied to essential functions/words we use everyday. "danger" is red, "success" is green,
"link" is blue.  These can be used for almost anything.  Still not satisfied with that navbar? "navbar is-dark", now for each of my text elements "has-text-light".  Much better.  On top of all of the simplicity that Bulma provide, it is integrated with fontawesome.  So go give Bulma a "fas fa-thumbs-up is-success" and enjoy simple, intuitive, yet effective css framework!

Happy coding!
