If you came up to me a few years ago and told me I'd be a developer, I would have laughed and told you I could never do that.  Developers might as well have been rocket scientists to me.  Technology has always been a passion of mine, and I never once considerd it a profession.  One day I met up with some friends of mine and one of them was working on his laptop.  I took a peak and the gibberish I saw was code.  Amazed, I started asking all kinds of questions; what does this mean, when did you start, what do you do?  He worked for iHeart Radio and he was a developer for them.  Again amazed.  This man was no roocket scientist, just someone I knew.  At that moment I knew it was possible for me to learn the same skills.  Before commiting to a complete change in my career I gave it a test run.  CodeAcademy gave me just a taste of the possibilities.  After writing my first alert message and seeing it pop up on my screen, my mind was blown.  I wrote that, me.  It was one line and said the typical "Hello World", but I wrote it.  Instantly I knew this was for me and started searching for schools.  Flatiron came up from multiple searches as well as a reference from my developer friend.  An application and interview was required to be considered.  I did as much of the free courses as I could to prepare and it paid off. The acceptance email was just another victory on a long road ahead.  Fast forward and here I am.  My final project is finished about to be submitted for my final assessment.  It was a long time comming but I have never been so proud of myself.  What a journey it has been, and I am just getting started.
