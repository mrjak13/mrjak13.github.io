I did not want to start this project, and almost put it off.  There was this overwhelming fear that I wouldn't know anything or stare at that blank screen for days.  "What do you mean I have to write a program to do anything?" I kept asking myself.  After getting over this fear I took my first step and watched Avi's guides.  They were informative like always and taking down physical notes helped.  Hours of video lectures later, it was finally time to start this.

**Starting out rough**

I started this project using 'bundle gem' and read through the README and it said to install my gem in my own gemfile folder, so i did.  Turns out that was not meant for me, but whoever was to use it later on.  The gems and environment folders  were giving me nothing but trouble.  I looked back at previous labs and lectures for references to get the bones of this project up and running.

Once the evironment and gems were all functioning it was time for the fun to begin.  I wanted to create a mini CLI version of the Steam Store.  It will take the information off of the homepage and will return it in the command line.  At the bottom of the site there are several tabs; "New and Trending, Top Sellingm Popular Upcoming, and Specials.  My new plan was to have a choice between which list the user wanted and to go from there.

**A work in progress**

The longer I worked on this gem the more I wanted out of it.  What if you could log in and have access to your profile, friends list, etc...  Something I have no idea how to do.  I am leaving this as an unfinished project, and will dive back into it with more knowledge to add more functionality.
